Bags, Queues, and Stacks
========================

Bags
----

- a collection where removing items is unsupported
- iterate through a collection of items
- unspecified iteration order

Queues
------

- FIFO (First in, first out)

Stacks
------

- LIFO (Last in, first out)
- Can be used to evaluate fully parenthesized mathematical expressions with the following algo:
■ Push operands onto the operand stack.
■ Push operators onto the operator stack.
■ Ignore left parentheses.
■ On encountering a right parenthesis, pop an operator, pop the requisite number
of operands, and push onto the operand stack the result of applying that opera-
tor to those operands.
